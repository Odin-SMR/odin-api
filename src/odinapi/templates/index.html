          Please note that due to a processing error Level2 data covering the
          period May 2009 to July 2014 should be treated with caution. Simply
          put, files with names referring to a particular orbit do not
          necessarily contain data from that orbit.  The problem becomes
          progressively worse with time.  Reprocessing of this period will
          commence soon.  Watch this space for more details! <p>

          <p class="lead">The Odin satellite was launched in February 2001 and
          was designed to combine two scientific disciplines on a single
          spacecraft for studying of star formation and the early solar system
          (astronomy) and the mechanisms behind the depletion of the ozone
          layer in the Earth's atmosphere and the effects of global warming
          (aeronomy).</p>

          <p>The satellite has been used as a true observatory in order to best
          respond to scientific challenges. The astronomy mission was
          successfully concluded in the spring of 2007 and since then the
          satellite has been used exclusively for studies of the Earthâ€™s
          atmosphere. During the first three years of the Odin mission, when
          both astronomy and aeronomy observations were conducted, the
          available observing time was shared equally between the two
          disciplines.</p>

<!--
<p>The main instrument on Odin is an advanced radiometer using a 1.1 m
telescope, designed to be used for both the astronomy and aeronomy missions.
The radiometer works in essentially unexplored frequency bands (486-580 GHz and
at 119 GHz) with an unsurpassed sensitivity and spatial resolution.

<p>For the aeronomy mission the payload is complemented by a spectrograph,
named OSIRIS (Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System). OSIRIS
provides simultaneous observations in two channels; a UV/Visible channel with a
passband of 280-800 nm, and an IR channel with a total pass band of 30 nm,
centered on 1.27 microns.</p>

<p>In order to fulfill the scientific requirements Odin is 3-axis stabilized,
capable of switching between astronomy and aeronomy modes. It can be staring at
astronomical targets for hours with an accuracy of 15 arc seconds or can scan
the limb of the Earth's atmosphere at various speeds between 10 and 120 km
altitudes, 40 times per orbit, with a reconstructed accuracy of 1.2 arc
minutes. The entire satellite is pointed towards the targets.</p>

<p>Odin was placed into a 600 km sun-synchronous, terminator orbit by a START-1
rocket on 20 February 2001 from Svobodny, far eastern Russia.</p>

<p>The Swedish Space Corporation, on behalf of the Swedish National Space Board
and the space agencies of Canada (CSA), Finland (TEKES) and France (CNES), has
developed the satellite for astronomers and atmospheric researchers in the
participating countries. The satellite is operated from a ground station at
Esrange.  </p>

            Since the launch of Odin in 2001 the Department of Earth and Space
            Sciences at Chalmers has been responsible for processing the Level2

             href="https://earth.esa.int/web/sppa/home">ESA/SPPA</a> decided to
           support the reprocessing of the Odin/SMR data set, which is now in
           progress.</p>

          <p> The Odin mission has been supported by ESA since 2007. Odin is a
